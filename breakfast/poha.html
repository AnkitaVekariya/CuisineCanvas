                <p><span>Rinse the poha in a colander under running water for a few seconds. Drain excess water and set aside. Be gentle while rinsing to avoid breaking the poha.

                    Heat oil in a pan or kadhai over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Let them splutter.
                    Add chopped onions, green chilies, and curry leaves. Saut√© until onions turn translucent.
                    If using potatoes, add diced potatoes to the pan. Cook until they are tender.
                    Add turmeric powder and mix well.
                    Adding Poha:

                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Lower the heat and add the rinsed poha to the pan. Gently toss to combine with the onion mixture. Be careful not to break the poha.
                    Add salt to taste and mix well. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the poha is heated through.

                <p><span>You can customize your poha by adding ingredients like peas, chopped carrots, or shredded coconut.
                    Some people also like to sprinkle a little sugar on their poha before serving for a hint of sweetness.
                    Serving: 
                    Poha is typically served as a breakfast dish, but it can also be enjoyed as a light snack or even for lunch.
