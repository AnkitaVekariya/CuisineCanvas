                <p><span>In a large mixing bowl, combine gram flour, semolina, ginger-green chili paste, yogurt, water, lemon juice, sugar, and salt. Mix well to form a smooth batter without any lumps. The consistency should be thick yet pourable.
                    Let the batter rest for about 15-20 minutes.
                    Prepare the steamer:
                    
                </span></p>

                    Grease a shallow dish or thali with oil and keep it ready. Also, prepare your steamer by bringing water to a boil.
                    Add fruit salt:

                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Just before steaming, add fruit salt (eno) or baking soda to the batter. Mix gently and immediately pour the batter into the greased dish.
                    Steam the khaman:
                </span></p>
            </div>

                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Place the greased dish into the steamer and cover it with a lid.
                    Steam the khaman for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
                    Once done, turn off the heat and remove the dish from the steamer. Allow it to cool for a few minutes.
                    Prepare the tempering:</span></p>

                <p><span>Serve the khaman warm with green chutney or tamarind chutney.
                    It can also be served with a sprinkle of sev or nylon sev for extra crunchiness.
