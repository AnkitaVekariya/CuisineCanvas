                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Rinse the rice and urad dal separately under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak them in separate bowls with enough water for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.
                        If using fenugreek seeds, add them to the urad dal while soaking.
                </span></p>

            <div class="item">

                <p><span>
                    After soaking, drain the water from both the rice and urad dal. Transfer them to a blender or grinder. Add a little water and grind to a smooth batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter. Add salt to taste and mix well.

                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Transfer the batter to a large bowl and cover it with a clean cloth. Allow it to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours, or until it increases in volume and becomes slightly airy.
                    Once the batter is fermented, gently stir it. If it's too thick, add a little water to adjust the consistency.   
                </span></p>

                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Heat a non-stick skillet or dosa pan over medium heat. Once hot, pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan.
                    Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin layer. Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa.</span></p>

                <div class="num">5.</div>
                <p><span>Cook the dosa for 1-2 minutes, or until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown.
                    Flip the dosa using a spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side.

                    Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the pan lightly with oil or ghee before making each dosa.
