                <p><span>Rinse the rice and urad dal separately under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak them in separate bowls with enough water for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. If using fenugreek seeds, add them to the urad dal while soaking.</span></p>

                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>After soaking, drain the water from both the rice and urad dal. Transfer them to a blender or grinder. Add a little water and grind to a smooth batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter. Add salt to taste and mix well.</span></p>

                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Transfer the batter to a large bowl and cover it with a clean cloth. Allow it to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours, or until it increases in volume and becomes slightly airy. Once the batter is fermented, gently stir it. If it's too thick, add a little water to adjust the consistency.</span></p>

                <p><span>To prepare the potato filling, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. When they start to splutter, add the finely chopped onions, green chilies, and grated ginger. Saut√© until the onions turn golden brown.</span></p>

                <p><span>Heat a non-stick skillet or dosa pan over medium heat. Once hot, pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin layer. Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa.</span></p>
