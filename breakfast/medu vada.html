                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Rinse the urad dal under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the urad dal in enough water for 4-6 hours or overnight.
                    
                </span></p>

                <p><span>
                    After soaking, drain the water from the urad dal and transfer it to a blender or food processor. Grind the urad dal into a smooth and thick batter. Avoid adding too much water while grinding; you may need to scrape down the sides of the blender a few times to ensure even grinding.

                <p><span>Transfer the urad dal batter to a mixing bowl. Add chopped green chilies, grated ginger, chopped curry leaves, chopped coriander leaves, whole black peppercorns, and salt to taste. Mix everything well to combine.

                <p><span>Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or frying pan over medium heat.
                   To shape the vadas, wet your hands with water to prevent the batter from sticking. Take a lemon-sized portion of the batter and shape it into a ball. Flatten the ball slightly and make a hole in the center to form a donut shape.</span></p>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">5.</div>
                <p><span>Carefully slide the shaped vadas into the hot oil. You can fry multiple vadas at a time, depending on the size of your frying pan, but do not overcrowd the pan.
                    Fry the vadas on medium heat until they turn golden brown and crispy on both sides. Make sure to flip them occasionally for even frying.

                <p><span>
                    Once the vadas are cooked through and golden brown, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.
                    Repeat the process with the remaining batter until all the vadas are fried.

                    Serve the hot and crispy medu vadas with coconut chutney, sambar, or any dipping sauce of your choice.
