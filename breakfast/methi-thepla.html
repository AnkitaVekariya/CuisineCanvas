                <p><span>In a large mixing bowl, combine chopped fenugreek leaves, whole wheat flour, besan, yogurt, oil, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, carom seeds, and salt.
                    Mix all the ingredients well. The mixture should resemble coarse crumbs.
                    
                </span></p>

                <p><span>
                    Gradually add water, little by little, and knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. The dough should be firm yet pliable.
                    Cover the dough and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>After resting, divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls.
                    Take one ball of dough and roll it out into a thin circle, using a rolling pin and some dry flour for dusting.
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium heat. Place the rolled thepla on the hot tawa.
                    Cook for about a minute until small bubbles start to appear on the surface.</span></p>

                <div class="num">5.</div>
                <p><span>Flip the thepla and spread some oil or ghee on the cooked side.
                    Cook the other side until golden brown spots appear, pressing gently with a spatula.
                    Flip again and cook the first side until golden brown spots appear and the thepla is cooked through.

                <p><span>Remove the cooked thepla from the tawa and keep it warm in a covered container.
                    Repeat the same process with the remaining dough balls.
