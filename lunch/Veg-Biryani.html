                <p><span>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice along with whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) and salt.
                    Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% done. Drain the rice and set aside.                </span></p>

                <div class="num">Preparing Vegetable Mixture:</div>
                <p><span>Heat ghee or oil in a separate pan. Add sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                    Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
                    Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.
                    Add mixed vegetables and sauté for a few minutes until they are partially cooked.
                    In a bowl, whisk yogurt with red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Add this mixture to the pan and mix well. Cook for a couple of minutes until the vegetables are coated with the spices.                </span></p>

                    Spread a layer of the cooked vegetable mixture on top of the rice.
                    Repeat the layers with the remaining rice and vegetable mixture. Sprinkle some fried onions and chopped cilantro leaves on the top.
