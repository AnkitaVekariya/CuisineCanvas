                <p><span>Rinse the toor dal under running water until the water runs clear. Then, soak the dal in water for about 30 minutes.

                    In a pressure cooker, add the soaked toor dal along with chopped onion, tomato, diced carrot, potato, eggplant, mixed vegetables, tamarind paste, sambar powder, turmeric powder, and salt.

                    Close the pressure cooker with its lid and cook the dal and vegetables over medium heat for about 4-5 whistles, or until the dal and vegetables are cooked and soft.

                <p><span>Once the pressure releases naturally, open the pressure cooker and mash the dal and vegetables lightly using a spoon or a potato masher. Adjust the consistency by adding more water if needed.

                    Place the pressure cooker back on the stove over low heat.
                    
                    Prepare the tempering (tadka) by heating oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then, add cumin seeds, dried red chilies, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Fry for a few seconds until the spices become fragrant.

                    Let the sambar simmer for another 5-10 minutes over low heat, allowing the flavors to blend.
