            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Prepare the dough:</div>
                <p><span>In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Gradually add water and knead to form a soft and smooth dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Prepare the potato filling:</div>
                <p><span>In another bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, finely chopped onion (if using), green chilies, grated ginger, cumin seeds, coriander powder, garam masala, amchur powder or chaat masala, chopped coriander leaves, and salt. Mix everything well to combine.
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Divide the dough and filling:  </div>
                <p><span>After resting, divide the dough into equal-sized balls, slightly smaller than the size of a tennis ball. Divide the potato filling into portions accordingly.
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Roll out the dough balls:</div>
                <p><span>Take one portion of dough and flatten it into a small disk using your fingers. Dust it lightly with flour and roll it out into a small circle, about 4-5 inches in diameter.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Stuff and seal the paratha:</div>
                <p><span>Place a portion of the potato filling in the center of the rolled-out dough circle. Bring the edges of the dough together to cover the filling and pinch to seal, ensuring there are no cracks.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Roll out the stuffed dough ball:</div>
                <p><span>Gently flatten the stuffed dough ball with your hands. Dust it lightly with flour and roll it out into a circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter. Be careful not to put too much pressure as you roll, as this may cause the filling to burst out.</span></p>
            </div> 

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Cook the paratha:</div>
                <p><span>Heat a tawa (griddle) or a non-stick pan over medium heat. Once hot, place the rolled-out paratha on the tawa.
                    Cook for about 1-2 minutes on one side until small bubbles start to appear on the surface.
                    Flip the paratha and drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges and on the surface.
                    Cook for another 1-2 minutes, pressing gently with a spatula, until both sides are golden brown and crispy.</span></p>
