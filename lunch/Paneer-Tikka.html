                <div class="num">Marinating Paneer:</div>
                <p><span>In a mixing bowl, combine thick yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, garam masala, salt, and oil. Mix well to form a smooth marinade.
                    Add paneer cubes to the marinade and gently coat them with the mixture. Allow the paneer to marinate for at least 1-2 hours in the refrigerator. The longer it marinates, the more flavorful it will be.                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Preparing Skewers (Optional):</div>
                <p><span>If using skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes to prevent them from burning during grilling.
                    Thread the marinated paneer cubes, onion chunks, bell pepper chunks, and cherry tomatoes alternately onto the skewers. Repeat until all the skewers are filled.                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Grilling or Baking:</div>
                <p><span>Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat.
                    Brush the grill grates or baking tray with oil to prevent sticking.
                    Place the skewers on the grill or baking tray, leaving some space between each skewer.
                    Grill or bake the paneer tikka for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the paneer is golden brown and slightly charred on the edges.
                    If using an oven, you can also broil the paneer tikka for a few minutes at the end for extra charred flavor.                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">Finishing Touch:</div>
                <p><span>Once cooked, remove the paneer tikka from the grill or oven and transfer them to a serving plate.
                    Sprinkle some chaat masala on top for extra flavor (optional).
                    Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.</span></p>
