                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Prepare the Moong Dal:
                    Rinse the split yellow lentils (moong dal) under cold water until the water runs clear.
                    Soak the rinsed moong dal in enough water for about 4-5 hours or overnight.
                    After soaking, drain the water from the moong dal and grind it into a coarse paste using a food processor or blender. Avoid adding water while grinding.

                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>Cook the Moong Dal:
                    Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai over medium heat.
                    Add the ground moong dal to the hot ghee and roast it, stirring continuously to prevent burning.
                    Roast the moong dal until it turns aromatic and changes color to a golden brown. This process will take about 15-20 minutes.
                    Once the moong dal is roasted, reduce the heat to low.</span></p>

                <p><span>Add Milk and Cook:
                    Gradually add milk to the roasted moong dal, stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.
                    Cook the moong dal in milk over low heat, stirring frequently, until the milk is absorbed and the mixture thickens. This will take about 20-25 minutes.
                    Keep stirring to prevent sticking to the bottom of the pan.
                    
                </span></p>

                <p><span>Add Sugar and Flavorings:
                    Once the moong dal is cooked and the milk is absorbed, add sugar to the mixture.
                    Stir well to combine the sugar with the moong dal mixture.
                    Add cardamom powder to the mixture and mix again.
                    Cook the mixture for another 5-7 minutes until the sugar is fully dissolved and the halwa thickens further.
