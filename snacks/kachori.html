                <p><span>Preparing the dough:

                    In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, salt, and ghee/oil.
                    Rub the ghee/oil into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs.
                    Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.

                <p><span>Preparing the filling:

                    Drain the soaked moong dal and grind it into a coarse paste without adding water.
                    Heat oil in a pan over medium heat.
                    Add cumin seeds and asafoetida. Let them splutter.
                    Add ginger paste and green chili paste. Saut√© for a minute.
                    Add the ground moong dal paste and cook on low to medium heat, stirring continuously, until it becomes thick and dry.
                    Add crushed fennel seeds, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, dry mango powder, and salt. Mix well.
                    Cook the mixture for another 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and let the filling cool down.

                <p><span>Assembling and frying:

                    Divide the dough into equal-sized balls.
                    Take one portion of the dough and roll it into a small disc of about 3-4 inches in diameter.
                    Place a spoonful of the prepared filling in the center of the disc.
                    Gather the edges of the disc to enclose the filling and pinch them together to seal.
                    Gently flatten the filled dough ball with your palms.
                    Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.
                    Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep frying pan over medium heat.
                    Once the oil is hot, gently slide in the prepared kachoris, in batches, and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy from all sides.
