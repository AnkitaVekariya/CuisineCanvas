                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan. Add chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until onions turn translucent.

                    Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute.
                    
                    Add mixed vegetables and cook until they are tender, but still have a crunch.

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a minute.

                    Turn off the heat and transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Let it cool down slightly.
                    
                    Once the vegetable mixture has cooled, add mashed potatoes, chopped coriander leaves, lemon juice, and breadcrumbs. Mix everything well to form a dough-like mixture.

                <p><span>Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into cutlets or patties of desired shape and size.

                    In a small bowl, mix all-purpose flour with water to make a thin slurry.
                    
                    Dip each cutlet into the flour slurry and then coat it with breadcrumbs. Repeat this step for all the cutlets.

                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Heat oil in a pan for shallow frying. Once the oil is hot, place the cutlets in the pan.

                    Shallow fry the cutlets until they turn golden brown and crispy on both sides. Flip them carefully to ensure even cooking.
                    
                    Once done, remove the cutlets from the pan and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</span></p>
