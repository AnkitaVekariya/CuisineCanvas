                <p><span>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:
                    In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, saffron strands, and crushed cardamom pods.
                    Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.
                    Let the syrup simmer for about 5-7 minutes until it reaches a slightly sticky consistency.
                    Turn off the heat and keep the sugar syrup warm.

                <p><span>Prepare the Gulab Jamun Dough:
                    In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.
                    Add ghee or melted butter to the dry ingredients and mix well.
                    Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and knead into a smooth and soft dough. The dough should be soft but not sticky.
                    If the dough is too dry, add a little more milk. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour.
                    Add a pinch of cardamom powder to the dough and knead again to incorporate the flavor.

                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Shape and Fry the Gulab Jamuns:
                    Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion between your palms to form smooth balls without any cracks. Make sure they are smooth and uniform in size.
                    Heat ghee or vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-low heat. The temperature of the oil should be around 300-325°F (150-160°C).
                    Once the oil is hot, gently slide a few gulab jamun balls into the oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.
                    Fry the gulab jamuns on low to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown and evenly colored from all sides. This will take about 8-10 minutes.
                    Remove the fried gulab jamuns using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.

                <p><span>Soak the Gulab Jamuns:
                    While the gulab jamuns are still hot, transfer them to the warm sugar syrup.
                    Let the gulab jamuns soak in the syrup for at least 2-3 hours or overnight. They will absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.
