        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <div class="instruction">
            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Roast the Besan (Chickpea Flour):
                    Heat a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai over low to medium heat.
                    Add besan (chickpea flour) to the pan and dry roast it, stirring continuously to prevent burning.
                    Roast the besan until it turns aromatic and changes color to a golden brown. This process will take about 10-15 minutes. Be patient and keep stirring to ensure even roasting.
                    Once roasted, remove the besan from the heat and transfer it to a plate to cool down slightly.
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>Prepare the Ladoo Mixture:
                    In the same pan, heat ghee (clarified butter) over low heat until it melts completely.
                    Add the roasted besan back to the pan with melted ghee.
                    Stir well to combine the besan and ghee, making sure there are no lumps. Cook the mixture over low heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously.
                    The mixture will start to thicken and turn slightly darker in color. Be careful not to burn it.
                    After 5-7 minutes, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down for a few minutes.
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Add Sugar and Flavorings:
                    Once the besan mixture has cooled down slightly but is still warm, add powdered sugar and cardamom powder.
                    Mix well until the sugar is fully incorporated into the besan mixture.
                    Add chopped nuts and raisins (if using) to the mixture and mix again.
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Shape the Ladoos:
                    Take a small portion of the besan mixture in your hands and shape it into a smooth, round ball (ladoo). Press the mixture firmly while shaping the ladoos to ensure they hold their shape.
                    Repeat the process with the remaining besan mixture to make more ladoos.
                    
                    </span></p>
            </div>

           

            <p class="description">
                Optionally, you can garnish the besan ladoos with additional chopped nuts or edible silver foil (varak) for decoration.
                Let the besan ladoos cool completely before storing them in an airtight container.
                Enjoy the delicious homemade besan ladoos as a sweet treat or dessert!
