        <h3>Prepare the Ice Cream Base:</h3>
        <div class="instruction">
            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Prepare the Paneer Dumplings (Rasgullas):
                    In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring 1 liter of milk to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.
                    Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and add lemon juice or vinegar gradually, stirring continuously. This will cause the milk to curdle.
                    Keep stirring until the whey (greenish water) separates completely from the curdled milk, and the milk solids (paneer) are fully separated.
                    Turn off the heat and let it sit for a minute.             
                </span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>Place a muslin cloth or cheesecloth over a large strainer set over a bowl. Pour the curdled milk into the strainer to separate the whey from the paneer.
                    Gather the corners of the cloth and rinse the paneer under cold water to remove the sourness of the lemon juice or vinegar.
                    Tie the cloth tightly and hang it for about 30 minutes to drain excess water.. </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>You can also place a heavy object over the cloth to press out excess water.
                    After 30 minutes, remove the paneer from the cloth. Knead it on a clean surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and soft.
                    Divide the kneaded paneer into small portions and roll them into smooth balls without any cracks. Press each ball gently between your palms to flatten slightly.

                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:
                    In a wide pan, bring 4 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar to a boil over medium heat.
                    Once the sugar is completely dissolved and the water comes to a rolling boil, gently drop the paneer balls into the syrup.
                    Cover the pan with a lid and let the paneer balls cook in the syrup for about 15-20 minutes. They will double in size while cooking.
                    After 15-20 minutes, turn off the heat and let the paneer balls cool in the sugar syrup for at least 1 hour.
            </span></p>

                <p><span>Prepare the Milk Mixture:
                    In another wide pan, bring 1 liter of milk to a boil over medium heat.
                    Add saffron strands and cardamom powder to the boiling milk, and continue to simmer until the milk reduces to about half its original volume.
                    Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
                    Once the milk has thickened and reduced, add sugar according to your taste preference. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
                    Turn off the heat and let the saffron-flavored milk mixture cool to room temperature.

                <p><span>Assemble the Rasmalai:
                    Gently squeeze the excess syrup from the cooked paneer balls and transfer them to a serving dish.
                    Pour the cooled saffron-flavored milk mixture over the paneer balls, covering them completely.
                    Garnish with chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios) on top.
                    Refrigerate the rasmalai for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld together and serve chilled.
