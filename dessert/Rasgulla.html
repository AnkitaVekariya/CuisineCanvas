                <p><span>Prepare the Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese):
                    In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the milk to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.
                    Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and add lemon juice or vinegar gradually, stirring continuously. This will cause the milk to curdle.
                    Keep stirring until the whey (greenish water) separates completely from the curdled milk, and the milk solids (paneer) are fully separated.
                    Turn off the heat and let it sit for a minute.
                    Place a muslin cloth or cheesecloth over a large strainer set over a bowl. Pour the curdled milk into the strainer to separate the whey from the paneer.
                    Gather the corners of the cloth and rinse the paneer under cold water to remove the sourness of the lemon juice or vinegar.
                    Tie the cloth tightly and hang it for about 30 minutes to drain excess water. You can also place a heavy object over the cloth to press out excess water.
                    After 30 minutes, remove the paneer from the cloth. Knead it on a clean surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and soft. This helps in making smooth rasgullas.

                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>Shape the Rasgullas:
                    Divide the kneaded paneer into small portions and roll them into smooth balls without any cracks. Make sure there are no cracks, or else the rasgullas may break while cooking.
                    Press each ball gently between your palms to flatten slightly. They will puff up while cooking, so don't flatten them too much.

                <p><span>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:
                    In a wide pan, combine sugar, water, crushed cardamom pods, and saffron strands (if using).
                    Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.
                    Let the syrup simmer for a few minutes until slightly thickened. Remove any impurities or foam that rises to the surface.

                <p><span>Cook the Rasgullas:
                    Gently slide the prepared paneer balls into the simmering sugar syrup.
                    Cover the pan with a lid and let the rasgullas cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes. They will double in size while cooking, so make sure there's enough space in the pan.
                    After 15-20 minutes, turn off the heat and let the rasgullas cool in the sugar syrup for at least 1 hour.
                    </span></p>
            </div>

            <p class="description">
                Once cooled, transfer the rasgullas along with the sugar syrup to a serving bowl.
                Serve the soft and spongy rasgullas chilled or at room temperature.
                Enjoy the delicious homemade rasgullas as a delightful sweet treat!
