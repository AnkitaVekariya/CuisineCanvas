                <p><span>Preparation:
                    Rinse the Basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.
                    Soak the saffron strands in 1 tablespoon of warm milk and set aside.
                    Crush the cardamom pods using a mortar and pestle to release their flavor.

                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>Cooking the Rice:
                    In a heavy-bottomed pan or a deep saucepan, heat the ghee over medium heat.
                    Add the rinsed Basmati rice to the pan and saut√© for 2-3 minutes until it turns light golden brown and aromatic.
                    Pour in the whole milk and stir well to combine.
                    Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and to ensure even cooking.

                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Adding Sugar and Flavors:
                    Once the rice is almost cooked and the mixture has thickened, add the sugar and mix well until it dissolves completely.
                    Add the crushed cardamom pods and the saffron-soaked milk. Stir to incorporate the flavors.
                    Optionally, you can add rose water at this stage for a fragrant touch. Mix well.

                <p><span>Adding Dry Fruits:
                    Add the chopped mixed dry fruits (almonds, cashews, pistachios, raisins) to the kheer. Reserve some for garnish if desired.
                    Continue to simmer the kheer for another 5-10 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and the mixture reaches a creamy consistency. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
                    </span></p>
            </div>

            <p class="description">
                Once the kheer is ready, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
                Serve the kheer warm or chilled, garnished with silvered almonds, pistachios, and edible rose petals if desired.
