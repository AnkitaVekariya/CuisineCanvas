                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Grind the Cashew Nuts:
                    Grind the cashew nuts into a fine powder using a high-speed blender or a food processor. 
                    Make sure not to over-grind, or the cashews may release their oils and become paste-like.        
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>
                    Prepare the Sugar Syrup:In a non-stick pan or a heavy-bottomed pan, add sugar and water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring 
                    continuouslyuntil the sugar dissolves completely.Once the sugar is dissolved, continue to cook the syrup until it reaches a one-string consistency. 
                    To check the consistency, take a small amount of syrup between your thumb and index finger. When you separate the fingers, a single string should form.
                    Once the syrup reaches the desired consistency, reduce the heat to low.

                <p><span>Make the Kaju Katli Mixture:
                    Add the powdered cashew nuts to the sugar syrup and mix well.
                    Stir the mixture continuously over low heat until it thickens and starts leaving the sides of the pan. This will take about 5-7 minutes.
                    Add ghee to the mixture and continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously.                    
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Shape the Kaju Katli:
                    Transfer the thickened cashew mixture to a greased plate or a parchment paper-lined surface.
                    Allow the mixture to cool down slightly until it's safe to handle.
                    Knead the mixture gently to form a smooth dough-like consistency.
                    Place another piece of parchment paper over the dough and roll it out evenly using a rolling pin to your desired thickness 
                    (typically around 1/4 inch thick).
                    While the mixture is still warm, use a knife or a cookie cutter to cut it into diamond-shaped pieces or squares. 
                    You can also leave it in the shape of the plate or tray.
                    </span></p>

                <p><span>
                    Garnish and Serve:Optionally, garnish each piece of Kaju Katli with a thin silver leaf (varak) for a decorative touch.
                    Let the Kaju Katli cool completely at room temperature for a few hours to set.
                    Once set, carefully remove the individual pieces from the parchment paper.
                    Store the Kaju Katli in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. If the weather is warm, you can store them in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life.
