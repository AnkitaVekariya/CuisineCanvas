            It seems you're referring to "cha," which is a traditional Tibetan butter tea. Here's a basic recipe to make cha:</p>
        
        <div class="recipe-step">
            <h2>Ingridents:</h2>
            <ul type="ingri">
                <li><span>3 cups water</span></li>
                <li><span>2 tablespoons loose black tea leaves (or 2 black tea bags)</span></li>
                <li><span>
                    1/2 cup milk (traditionally yak milk is used, but you can use any milk of your choice)
                </span></li>
                <li><span>
                    2 tablespoons unsalted butter (traditionally yak butter is used, but you can use any unsalted butter)
                </span></li>
                <li><span>

                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil.

                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>   
                    Once the water is boiling, add the loose black tea leaves or black tea bags to the saucepan. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes to brew the tea.

                <p><span>
                    After 5 minutes, reduce the heat to low and add the milk and unsalted butter to the saucepan.

                <p><span>Allow the mixture to simmer for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the butter has melted and the flavors have infused.</span></p>

                <div class="num">5.</div>
                <p><span>If desired, add a pinch of salt to taste. Traditionally, a small amount of salt is added to enhance the flavor of the tea.

                    Once the tea is ready, remove it from the heat and strain it into cups or a teapot to remove the tea leaves or tea bags.
                    Serve the cha hot and enjoy its rich and buttery flavor.
