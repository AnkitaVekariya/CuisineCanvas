                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Measure out the desired amount of coffee beans based on your preferred strength and the number of cups you want to make. A standard ratio is about 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds per 6 ounces of water.
                </span></p>

                <p><span>
                    Grind the coffee beans to the desired consistency. For most brewing methods, a medium grind is ideal. Adjust the grind size based on your brewing method - finer for espresso, coarser for French press.

                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Boil water in a kettle. The temperature of the water is important for brewing coffee. Ideally, it should be between 195째F to 205째F (90째C to 96째C). If you don't have a thermometer, bring the water to a boil and then let it sit for about 30 seconds before using it.

                    Place a coffee filter in your coffee maker or pour-over device. If you're using a French press, add the ground coffee directly to the press.
                    Add the ground coffee to the filter or French press.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">5.</div>
                <p><span>Slowly pour the hot water over the coffee grounds, making sure to saturate them evenly. For pour-over methods, pour in a circular motion starting from the center and moving outward. Stir the grounds gently to ensure even extraction.
                    Let the coffee steep or brew for the recommended time, usually between 3 to 5 minutes depending on your brewing method and personal preference.
                </span></p>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">6.</div>
                <p><span>
                    If you're using a pour-over method or drip coffee maker, remove the filter or stop the brewing process once the coffee is done brewing.
                    If using a French press, gently press down the plunger to separate the coffee grounds from the brewed coffee.
                    Pour the brewed coffee into cups or mugs and serve immediately.
                    Enjoy your freshly brewed cup of coffee!
