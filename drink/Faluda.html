                <p><span>Prepare the Falooda Sev:
                    Cook the falooda sev according to the package instructions. Usually, it involves boiling the sev in water until it's cooked but still retains a bit of bite. Once cooked, drain and rinse the sev under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside to cool.

                    Soak the Basil Seeds:
                    Rinse the basil seeds in water and soak them in about 1/2 cup of water. Let them soak for about 15-20 minutes until they swell up and form a gel-like consistency.
