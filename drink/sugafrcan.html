        <div class="instruction">
            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Select fresh and firm sugarcane stalks from the market. Look for ones with no visible signs of damage or mold.
                    Wash the sugarcane stalks thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris.
                </span></p>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>
                    Using a sharp knife, carefully peel off the tough outer layer of the sugarcane stalks to expose the juicy inner flesh.
                </span>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>If you have a sugarcane juicer, feed the chopped sugarcane pieces into the juicer chute and extract the juice according to the juicer's instructions.
                    If you don't have a sugarcane juicer, you can use a blender or food processor. Cut the sugarcane into smaller pieces and blend them with a little water until smooth. Strain the blended mixture through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to separate the juice from the pulp.

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Once you've extracted the sugarcane juice, strain it through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any remaining pulp or fibers.
                    Transfer the strained sugarcane juice into serving glasses.</span></p>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">5.</div>
                <p><span>Sugarcane juice is best served chilled. You can refrigerate it for a few hours before serving or add ice cubes to the glasses to chill it quickly.
                </span></p>

            <div class="item">

                    Enjoy sugarcane juice on its own as a refreshing beverage on hot summer days.
                    It pairs well with savory snacks like chaat, samosas, or pakoras.
                    You can also use sugarcane juice as a base for cocktails or mocktails by mixing it with other fruit juices or soda water.
