                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>Soak the almonds in warm water for 4-6 hours or overnight. This will soften the almonds and make them easier to blend.

                    After soaking, drain the water from the almonds and rinse them with fresh water.
                    Peel the skins off the almonds. The skins should easily slide off after soaking.

                <p><span>In a blender, add the peeled almonds and a little bit of milk (about 1/2 cup) to facilitate blending.
                    Blend until you get a smooth paste. You may need to scrape down the sides of the blender a few times to ensure all the almonds are blended.

                    If using saffron, add the soaked saffron strands along with the milk they were soaked in for added flavor and color.
                    Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
