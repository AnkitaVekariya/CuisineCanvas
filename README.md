Welcome to **Cuisine Canvas**, a frontend web project that beautifully showcases a variety of Indian dishes! The website features categories like appetizers, lunch, dinner, breakfast, drinks, chutneys, and more, with images and recipes for each dish. This project highlights my skills in HTML and CSS by creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Dish Display:** Each dish is presented with an image and recipe.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Elegant Layout:** Clean and visually appealing design using only HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** To structure the content of the website.
- **CSS3:** To style and enhance the appearance of the website.
