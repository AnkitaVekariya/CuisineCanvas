                <p><span>Prepare the Vadas:

                    Rinse the urad dal and moong dal (if using) under water until the water runs clear. Soak them together in water for 4-6 hours or overnight.
                    Drain the soaked dal and grind it into a smooth batter using minimal water. The batter should be thick and fluffy.
                    Add grated ginger, chopped green chilies, and salt to the batter. Mix well.
                    Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat.
                    Take a small portion of the batter in your hand and shape it into a small ball or flattened disc.
                    Gently slide the shaped batter into the hot oil and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy from all sides.
                    Remove the fried vadas using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels. Let them cool slightly.

                <p><span>Prepare the Yogurt Mixture:

                    Beat the plain yogurt until smooth and creamy.
                    Add roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, and salt to taste. Mix well.

                <p><span>Assemble the Dahi Vadas:

                    Take a bowl of water and soak the fried vadas in it for 15-20 minutes. This helps to soften the vadas.
                    Squeeze out the excess water from the vadas and gently press them between your palms to remove excess water.
                    Arrange the soaked vadas in a serving dish.
                    Pour the prepared yogurt mixture over the vadas, covering them completely.
                    Drizzle sweet tamarind chutney and green coriander chutney over the yogurt-covered vadas.
                    Sprinkle red chili powder, roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, and chopped coriander leaves over the top.
                    Refrigerate the dahi vadas for about 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together.
