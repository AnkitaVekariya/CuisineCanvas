                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <p><span>In a mixing bowl, combine the chickpea flour (besan), sliced onions, sliced potatoes, chopped green chilies, grated ginger, chopped coriander leaves, cumin seeds, carom seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt.

                    Mix all the ingredients well using your hands, ensuring that the spices are evenly distributed and the vegetables are coated with the flour mixture.
                    
                </span></p>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <p><span>Gradually add water to the mixture, a little at a time, and continue mixing until you get a thick batter consistency. The batter should coat the vegetables well.

                    Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.
                    
                </span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <p><span>Once the oil is hot, carefully drop spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the pakoras in batches for even cooking.

                    Fry the pakoras for a few minutes on one side until they turn golden brown and crispy. Then, flip them over using a slotted spoon and fry the other side until golden brown and crispy as well.

                <div class="num">4.</div>
                <p><span>Once the pakoras are cooked and golden brown on all sides, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.

                    Repeat the frying process with the remaining batter until all the pakoras are cooked.
                    </span></p>
