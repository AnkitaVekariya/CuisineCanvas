                <p><span>Making Papdi:

                    In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina, carom seeds, salt, and oil.
                    Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough.
                    Cover the dough and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.
                    Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut it into small rounds using a cookie cutter or lid.
                    Prick each round with a fork to prevent puffing while frying.
                    Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or frying pan over medium heat.
                    Fry the papdi in batches until they turn golden brown and crispy.
                    Remove the fried papdi using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on kitchen paper towels.

                    Arrange the papdi on a serving plate.

                    Spoon beaten yogurt over the papdi.
                    Sprinkle roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, red chili powder, and salt over the papdi.
